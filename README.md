CodeWorld aims to introduce the wonders of computing to high school students and the general population, regardless of their background. With CodeWorld Chrome Extension, you can easily benefit from having a progress tracker that encompasses all coding coursework or lessons you do. You can visualize your progress based on your status in the Explore map and get access to free resources we curate towards your needs as a beginner coder.

Each module from our Explore map also contains quizzes and mini-games to put your knowledge to the test. You get rewarded with points that are redeemable with partner companies, for example, access to free courses to continue honing your skills or a 3-month free membership to a technology-based subscription. This truly helps drive home our mission for social impact and to increase accessibility in technology.
